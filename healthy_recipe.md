**2. Vegetarian Moussaka**
**Ingredients:**
- 2 large eggplants, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds
- Salt
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 can (400g) crushed tomatoes
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1/2 cup red wine
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1 tsp ground allspice
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 bay leaf
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 3 tbsp butter

- 1 can (400g) chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 1 cup lentils, cooked

**Preparation Instructions:**
1. Lay the eggplant slices on a baking sheet and sprinkle with salt. Let sit for 30 minutes to draw out moisture, then pat dry.
2. In a large pan, heat some olive oil over medium heat and fry the eggplant slices until golden brown. Set aside on paper towels to drain excess oil.
3. In the same pan, add the onion and garlic, and cook until softened.
4. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, red wine, cinnamon, allspice, oregano, bay leaf, salt, and pepper. Add the chickpeas and lentils. Simmer for 20 minutes until thickened, then remove the bay leaf.
5. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
6. In a saucepan, melt the butter and stir in the flour to form a roux. Gradually whisk in the milk and cook until thickened. Stir in the nutmeg and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
7. In a baking dish, layer half of the eggplant slices, then spread the chickpea-lentil sauce over. Top with the remaining eggplant slices and pour the béchamel sauce over the top.
8. Sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan cheese and bake for 45 minutes until golden brown and bubbly.

**Serving Suggestions:**
Serve the vegetarian moussaka warm with a side of Greek salad and crusty bread.

**3. Baklava**
**Ingredients:**
- 1 package of phyllo dough (approx. 16 oz), thawed
- 2 cups walnuts, finely chopped
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 cup unsalted butter (or vegan butter), melted
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 cup water

- 1 tsp lemon juice

**Preparation Instructions:**
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).

3. Brush a 9x13 inch baking dish with melted butter. Layer 8 sheets of phyllo dough in the dish, brushing each with melted butter.
4. Sprinkle a thin layer of the walnut mixture over the phyllo. Add two more sheets of phyllo dough, brushing each with butter, and sprinkle with more walnut mixture. Repeat until all the walnut mixture is used.
5. Finish with a top layer of 8 sheets of phyllo, brushing each with butter.
6. Using a sharp knife, cut the baklava into diamond or square shapes.
7. Bake for 45-50 minutes until golden and crisp.

**Serving Suggestions:**
Serve the baklava at room temperature with a cup of Greek coffee or tea.

**Explanation of Replaced Ingredients:**
1. **Greek Salad**: The feta cheese can be replaced with vegan feta cheese to make it suitable for vegans while maintaining the essence of the salad.
2. **Moussaka**: The ground lamb or beef has been replaced with a combination of chickpeas and lentils to provide a hearty and protein-rich filling. Whole milk can be replaced with unsweetened plant-based milk, and Parmesan cheese can be replaced with vegan Parmesan cheese to make it vegan-friendly.
3. **Baklava**: Unsalted butter can be replaced with vegan butter, and honey can be replaced with agave syrup to make the baklava vegan-friendly without compromising its classic sweetness and texture.
