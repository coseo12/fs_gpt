      "Skip to main contentGlobal Energy Perspective 2023: Hydrogen outlookJanuary 10, 2024 | ArticleDespite some uncertainties across scenarios, global clean hydrogen demand is projected to grow significantly to 2050, but infrastructure scale-up and technology advancements are needed to meet projected demand.\n",
      " About the authorsThis article is a collaborative effort by Chiara Gulli, Bernd Heid, Jesse Noffsinger, Maurits Waardenburg, and Markus Wilthaner, representing views from McKinsey Energy Solutions.\n",
      "The Global Energy Perspective 2023 models the outlook for demand and supply of energy commodities across a 1.5°C pathway, aligned with the Paris Agreement, and four bottom-up energy transition scenarios. These energy transition scenarios examine outcomes ranging from warming of 1.6°C to 2.9°C by 2100 (scenario descriptions outlined below in sidebar “About the Global Energy Perspective 2023”). These wide-ranging scenarios sketch a range of outcomes based on varying underlying assumptions—for example, about the pace of technological progress and the level of policy enforcement. The scenarios are shaped by more than 400 drivers across sectors, technologies, policies, costs, and fuels, and serve as a fact base to inform decision makers on the challenges to be overcome to enable the energy transition. In this article, we explore how hydrogen could contribute to decarbonizing the energy system, uncertainties around hydrogen’s future role, and what it would take to set up a global hydrogen economy by 2050.\n",
      "Clean hydrogen demand is projected to increase to between 125 and 585 Mtpa by 2050Hydrogen demand today is largely supplied by fossil fuel-based steam methane reforming and driven by fertilizer production and refining. These industries are expected to lead the uptake of blue and green hydrogen until 2030 in the slower scenarios, as they switch their hydrogen-based operations to clean hydrogen. In parallel, “new” emerging applications—for instance in steel, in the production of synthetic fuels, and in heavy road transport—may begin to emerge in the faster scenarios.\n",
      "Nearly all hydrogen consumed today is grey hydrogen (approximately 90 million tons1Metric tons: 1 metric ton = 2,205 pounds. per annum [Mtpa]). However, demand for grey hydrogen is projected to decline as demand for clean hydrogen rises and costs of the green molecules eventually become more competitive.2Clean hydrogen includes both green hydrogen (hydrogen produced by the electrolysis of water using renewable energy as a power source) and blue hydrogen (hydrogen produced through steam reforming of natural gas or methane with carbon capture, utilization, and storage [CCUS]), and contrasts with grey hydrogen (hydrogen produced through the same process as blue hydrogen but without CCUS). By 2050, clean hydrogen demand could account for up to 73 to 100 percent (125 to 585 Mtpa) of total hydrogen demand, with only between less than 1 and 50 Mtpa of demand being met by grey hydrogen, depending on the scenario.\n",
      "After 2025, nearly all new hydrogen production coming online is expected to be clean hydrogen. This coincides with the start of the expected phaseout of grey hydrogen, driven by the growing cost competitiveness of clean hydrogen and commitments to decarbonize. Until 2030, clean hydrogen uptake is projected to be driven by existing applications switching from grey to blue and green hydrogen, but between 2030 and 2040 the uptake of hydrogen in new applications without existing demand is expected to drive the increase in clean hydrogen demand.\n",
      "After 2040, private and public sector commitments are projected to drive the uptake of clean hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels in emerging applications in the Further Acceleration and Achieved Commitments scenarios. Potential mechanisms that would be required to support demand growth of hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives in these applications include the implementation of, or increase in, CO2 pricing, quotas on sustainable fuels in aviation, or CO2-reduction targets in maritime transportation. On the other hand, in the Current Trajectory and Fading Momentum scenarios, hydrogen uptake is projected to be driven by a continuation of the current cost decline and the underlying growth in some of the fertilizer and chemicals markets that use hydrogen today, with limited new policy support.\n",
      "Some geographies, such as the European Union and United Kingdom, are expected to fully phase out grey hydrogen by 2050 in all scenarios except Fading Momentum. Grey hydrogen will likely play a larger role in the Fading Momentum scenario than in the faster energy transition scenarios, due to slower uptake of clean hydrogen in new sectors. In these sectors, uptake of clean hydrogen is projected to be limited until 2050.Industry is projected to drive the majority of clean hydrogen uptake until 2030, followed by a wider uptake in new applications by 2050Applications with existing demand will likely account for the majority of clean hydrogen demand throughout the 2020s, potentially driving the increase in clean hydrogen’s share of total hydrogen demand from less than 1 percent today to around 30 percent by 2030 in the Further Acceleration scenario.\n",
      "By 2040, clean hydrogen could play a larger role in new applications—especially in mobility, which is expected to be the largest “newcomer” for clean hydrogen demand by 2040 in the Further Acceleration scenario. Applications could range from fuel cell electric vehicles in long-haul, heavy-duty trucking to synthetic kerosene in aviation. The second largest newcomer is expected to be hydrogen used in (mainly industrial) heating, displacing natural gas. Combined, clean hydrogen uptake in existing applications and emerging applications could drive clean hydrogen’s share of total demand to 75 percent by 2040.\n",
      "By 2050, in the Further Acceleration scenario, mobility applications are projected to remain the largest drivers for clean hydrogen uptake, with road transport accounting for around 80 Mtpa and aviation around 50 Mtpa, with the remaining 15 Mtpa coming from maritime. Existing industrial applications and heating are projected to drive further clean hydrogen uptake, potentially resulting in clean hydrogen accounting for 95 percent of total hydrogen demand in 2050.\n",
      "However, uncertainties around demand growth remain. For example, power could drive an additional demand upside of between 60 and 70 Mtpa by 2050, on top of the projected demand in the Further Acceleration scenario. This could happen if hydrogen-fueled turbines or stationary fuel cells prove more competitive or have more public support than alternative technologies for the last-mile decarbonization of the energy system, such as long-duration energy storage technologies and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS).\n",
      "In the Fading Momentum scenario, the already existing end use of hydrogen in fertilizer production is expected to drive consumption far beyond 2030 corresponding with the lower total growth.\n",
      "The only sector that is not projected to see an increase in total hydrogen demand in 2050 compared to today is refining, with demand expected to peak in the late 2020s or early 2030s, depending on the scenario, driven by lower oil demand across scenarios.Uptake in new applications depends on operating environment, infrastructure development, and relative competitivenessGoing forward, the decarbonization agendas of governments and companies are expected to drive hydrogen uptake in new applications, as well as the decarbonization of existing grey hydrogen applications. However, in most regions, there is significant uncertainty around projected hydrogen uptake in these new applications across scenarios.\n",
      "The uncertainty surrounding hydrogen demand in emerging applications stems from a combination of factors, including lack of clarity in government support, the development of enabling infrastructure, and evolving competitive dynamics with other decarbonization technologies. For example, hydrogen’s role in decarbonizing aviation could depend on government support, as well as market dynamics and competition. First, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) quotas are needed across geographies to drive a switch from fossil fuel-based kerosene to clean alternatives. Second, hydrogen-based synthetic fuels would have to prove competitive with the main SAF alternatives, for instance biokerosene, either based on costs or constraints in the availability of feedstock necessary to produce biokerosene.\n",
      "Similarly, there is uncertainty about the switch from grey to clean hydrogen. Active mandates, such as CO2 prices and subsidies, will likely be needed to facilitate the decarbonization of existing hydrogen demand, as the switch will likely not be attractive based on economics alone.Infrastructure scale-up and technology advancements could be criticalIn key sectors, the timely deployment of infrastructure across the whole supply chain is projected to be needed to meet clean hydrogen demand.\n",
      "Several key enablers—mostly physical infrastructure—would have to be rolled out by 2050 to facilitate the future hydrogen economy. In the Achieved Commitments scenario, over 163,000 refueling stations for trucks would be needed globally, alongside a network of more than 40,000 kilometers of hydrogen pipelines in Europe alone.\n",
      "Technological advancements may also be needed to ensure the uptake of hydrogen in sectors where hydrogen technology is not yet mature, such as the further development of fuel cells for heavy-duty vehicles and marine vessels.\n",
      "Coordination between government and the private sector may be needed to ensure the required infrastructure is in place to meet hydrogen demand at the pace necessary to meet decarbonization commitments and with an attractive business case.\n",
      "The extent of the growth and advancement necessary to establish a hydrogen economy is not without precedent—historical adoption of natural gas in the European Union since the 1960s and 70s shows that it is possible to rapidly change an established energy system if the necessary competitiveness and support are in place.Asia is projected to remain the region with the largest hydrogen demand to 2050Despite uncertainties in regional and sectoral demand, Asia is projected to remain the biggest hydrogen consumer across scenarios, largely driven by the demand from chemicals that already exist today, and, to a lesser extent, the transport, iron, and steel sectors in China and India. In Japan and South Korea, a significant share of hydrogen demand is expected to come from electricity generation as ammonia and hydrogen are blended in existing coal and gas plants, respectively. As Asia will likely not produce enough hydrogen to meet its growing demand, the region might rely on imports from Oceania or the Middle East, for instance.\n",
      "In Europe and the United States, the chemicals sector is projected to remain a significant driver of hydrogen demand, but new applications in sectors including steel and production of synthetic fuels for aviation, maritime, and heavy road transport are also expected to contribute significantly to demand growth.Green hydrogen production is projected to be spread across regions, while blue hydrogen production is geography-specificBy 2050, green hydrogen is expected to dominate the global supply mix, with a share of between 50 and 65 percent across scenarios, as cost reductions in renewables and electrolyzers make this production route more cost competitive. Blue hydrogen is projected to account for the next largest share of supply, at between 20 and 35 percent.\n",
      "The ratio of blue to green hydrogen production is expected to differ significantly by region, driven mainly by cost factor developments. Blue hydrogen production is projected to be concentrated in regions with cost-competitive natural gas and CCUS, such as the Middle East and North America. By 2050, blue hydrogen production could require as much as around 500 billion cubic meters of natural gas (between 10 and 15 percent of global natural gas demand in the Further Acceleration scenario), and capacity to capture and store 750 to 1,000 megatons of CO2.\n",
      "Green hydrogen production is projected to have a higher share in regions with abundant and cost-competitive renewable resources, such as Australia and Iberia. The production of green hydrogen could potentially be constrained by a lack of renewable power. Globally, approximately a quarter of renewable electricity generation (around 14,000 terawatt-hours) could be required to produce the green hydrogen needed by 2050 in the Further Acceleration scenario. Further potential bottlenecks to be tackled to achieve strong green hydrogen uptake include large-scale investments and deployment of at-scale manufacturing of electrolyzers, with cost competitiveness being strongly dependent on the latter.Clean hydrogen cost competitiveness is projected to vary between regionsClean hydrogen production costs are expected to drop significantly by 2030–50, with large differences across regions under the scenarios explored. Cost differentials among regions could drive an increased mismatch between supply and demand centers and thus lead to the development of major hydrogen and hydrogen-derivatives export hubs.\n",
      "Regions with cost-competitive natural gas resources and CCUS, such as the Middle East, Norway, and the United States, are expected to have the highest cost competitiveness and could potentially account for 30 percent of exports at production costs of below $1.5/kg by 2050.\n",
      "Regions with access to low-cost renewable power, such as Australia or North Africa, could make up an additional 60 percent of exports at production costs of between $1.5/kg and $2/kg.\n",
      "The growing hydrogen trade could enable uptake in countries that have strong decarbonization ambitions but lack the necessary energy resources for clean hydrogen production, such as parts of Europe, as well as Japan and South Korea.A global hydrogen trade could emerge to connect demand centers with resource-rich export hubsMajor hydrogen trade flows are expected to evolve to connect export hubs with favorable renewable power or natural gas resources to two main demand regions: Asia and Europe.\n",
      "Europe could meet most of its demand from within the region, importing from countries with low gas prices or abundant hydro and solar power, such as Iberia and the Nordics. The remainder could be sourced from the Middle East, North Africa, and North America. Asia could source hydrogen from countries and regions like Australia, Latin America, the Middle East, and North America.\n",
      "Regions with favorable routes to market—either by producing and shipping as derivatives or building a strategic network of hydrogen pipelines toward off-takers, potentially re-using existing natural gas infrastructure—may also emerge as production hubs.\n",
      "While major trade flows in Europe will likely depend heavily on pipelines, shipping could prove critical to enable overseas trade. Hydrogen shipping could be expedited by converting hydrogen to synfuels (such as ammonia or methanol) at export hubs. Liquid hydrogen shipment could be one way to enable the global hydrogen trade after 2030, potentially increasing to approximately 20 Mtpa traded in 2050 in the faster scenarios.\n",
      "Although this projected ramp-up of the global hydrogen trade is ambitious, it does have historical precedent—similar growth was observed in the first 25 years of LNG development.\n",
      " About the Global Energy Perspective 2023 \n",
      "Hydrogen is a versatile energy carrier that has the potential to play a significant role in decarbonizing the energy system. Hydrogen-based technologies and fuels can provide low-carbon alternatives across sectors. However, as of now, there is still a wide range of possible hydrogen pathways up to 2050 both in terms of hydrogen demand and supply, leading to uncertainty for organizations looking to enter the hydrogen market or to scale their operations.\n",
      "Government and private sector support is projected to heavily affect hydrogen uptake. At the same time, future technological developments of alternatives (for instance, high-temperature electric furnaces, long-duration energy storage, and availability of biobased feedstock) could also create competition in some of the new applications for hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels. Hydrogen companies may benefit from closely monitoring signposts on policies, the development of hydrogen-enabling infrastructure, and the cost-competitiveness of hydrogen-based technologies compared to other low-carbon alternatives as they chart their way forward.\n",

      "The Global Hydrogen Review is an annual publication by the International Energy Agency that tracks hydrogen production and demand worldwide, as well as progress in critical areas such as infrastructure development, trade, policy, regulation, investments and innovation.The report is an output of the Clean Energy Ministerial Hydrogen Initiative and is intended to inform energy sector stakeholders on the status and future prospects of hydrogen, while also informing discussions at the Hydrogen Energy Ministerial Meeting organised by Japan. Focusing on hydrogen’s potentially major role in meeting international energy and climate goals, the Review aims to help decision makers fine-tune strategies to attract investment and facilitate deployment of hydrogen technologies at the same time as creating demand for hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels. It compares real-world developments with the stated ambitions of government and industry.This year’s report includes a focus on demand creation for low-emission hydrogen. Global hydrogen use is increasing, but demand remains so far concentrated in traditional uses in refining and the chemical industry and mostly met by hydrogen produced from unabated fossil fuels. To meet climate ambitions, there is an urgent need to switch hydrogen use in existing applications to low-emission hydrogen and to expand use to new applications in heavy industry or long-distance transport.This report is part of the IEA’s support of the first global stocktake of the Paris Agreement, which will be finalized in the run up to COP28, the next UN Climate Change Conference, at the end of 2023.

      "Low-emission hydrogen production can grow massively by 2030 but cost challenges are hampering deployment\n",
      "The number of announced projects for low-emission hydrogen production is rapidly expanding. Annual production of low-emission hydrogen could reach 38 Mt in 2030, if all announced projects are realised, although 17 Mt come from projects at early stages of development. The potential production by 2030 from announced projects to date is 50% larger than it was at the time of the release of the IEA’s Global Hydrogen Review 2022. Only 4% of this potential production has at least taken a final investment decision (FID), a doubling since last year in absolute terms (reaching nearly 2 Mt). Of the total, 27 Mt are based on electrolysis and low-emission electricity and 10 Mt on fossil fuels with carbon capture, utilisation and storage. \n",

      "After a slow start, China has taken the lead on electrolyser deployment. In 2020, China accounted for less than 10% of global electrolyser capacity installed for dedicated hydrogen production, concentrated in small demonstration projects. In 2022, installed capacity in China grew to more than 200 MW, representing 30% of global capacity, including the world’s largest electrolysis project (150 MW). By the end of 2023, China’s installed electrolyser capacity is expected to reach 1.2 GW – 50% of global capacity – with another new world record-size electrolysis project (260 MW), which started operation this year. China is poised to further cement its leading position in electrolyser deployment: the country accounts for more than 40% of the electrolysis projects that have reached FID globally.Equipment and financial costs are increasing, putting projects at risk and reducing the impact of government support for deployment. Inflation is increasing capital and financial costs, threatening the bankability of projects across the entire hydrogen value chain, which are highly capital intensive. For hydrogen produced from renewable electricity, for example, an increase of 3 percentage points in the cost of capital could raise total project cost by nearly one-third. Several projects have revised their initial cost estimates upwards by up to 50%. Inflationary pressures have coincided with a recent fall in natural gas prices, particularly in Europe, and with supply chain disruptions that affected project timelines. This means that announced government funding will support a smaller number of projects than could be expected previously, as greater investment is needed to close the cost gap between low-emission hydrogen and unabated fossil fuels-based hydrogen.Governments have started to make funding available to support the first large-scale projects, but slow implementation of support schemes is delaying investment decisions. North America and Europe have taken the lead in implementing initiatives to encourage low-emission hydrogen production. Large amounts of government funding are being made available through schemes such as the US Hydrogen Production Tax Credit, the EU Important Projects of Common European Interest and the UK Low Carbon Hydrogen Business Model. However, the lengthy time lags between the announcement of the schemes and the moment at which funds are made available to project developers is delaying project execution, and even putting projects at risk. This has been aggravated by the lack of clarity about regulation, which has only very recently been resolved in some jurisdictions. Electrolyser manufacturers have announced ambitious expansion plans. Manufacturers have announced that around 14 GW of manufacturing capacity are available today, half of which is in China. Electrolyser production in 2022 is estimated to be just over 1 GW. Manufacturers have announced plans for further expansion, aiming to reach 155 GW/year of manufacturing capacity by 2030, but only 8% of this capacity has at least reached FID. Realising manufacturers’ ambitious plans will depend on solid demand for electrolysers, which today is highly uncertain. Such uncertainty is already resulting in delays to these expansion plans, some of which are being put on hold.\n",
      "Efforts to stimulate low-emission hydrogen demand are lagging behind what is needed to meet climate ambitions\n",
      "Hydrogen demand reached a historical high in 2022, but it remains concentrated in traditional applications. Global hydrogen use reached 95 Mt in 2022, a nearly 3% increase year-on-year, with strong growth in all major consuming regions except Europe, which suffered a hit to industrial activity due to the sharp increase in natural gas prices. This global growth does not reflect a success of policy efforts to expand the use of hydrogen, but rather is linked to general global energy trends. Demand remains concentrated in industry and refining, with less than 0.1% coming from new applications in heavy industry, transport or power generation. Low-emission hydrogen is being taken up very slowly in existing applications, accounting for just 0.7% of total hydrogen demand, implying that hydrogen production and use in 2022 was linked to more than 900 Mt of CO2 emissions. Prospects are better in industry, particularly for ammonia production, with refining lagging behind.Measures to stimulate low-emission hydrogen use have only recently started to attract policy attention and are still not sufficient to meet climate ambitions. Government action has been focused on supporting low-emission hydrogen production, with less attention to the demand side. The sum of all government targets for low-emission hydrogen production accounts for 27-35 Mt today, but targets for creating demand account for just 14 Mt, less than half of which is focused on existing hydrogen uses. Even if these targets are met, they represent only one-fifth of the low-emission hydrogen use in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario) by 2030. Without robust demand, producers of low-emission hydrogen will not secure sufficient off-takers to underpin large-scale investments, jeopardising the viability of the entire low-emission hydrogen industry.The private sector has started moving to adopt low-emission hydrogen through off-take agreements, but efforts remain at very small scale. Companies have signed off-take agreements for up to 2 Mt of low-emission hydrogen, although more than half are preliminary agreements with non-binding conditions. Some companies are developing projects for an additional 3 Mt of low-emission hydrogen production for their own use, without the need for off-take agreements. But even with the addition of these quantities, low-emission hydrogen use is still far from what is needed to meet climate goals.International co-operation initiatives can help to aggregate demand for low-emission hydrogen, but demand signals from these initiatives are unclear. Governments and companies have launched a series of co-operation initiatives to foster deployment of low-emission technologies, including hydrogen. Based on the commitments made by these initiatives, they could create 0.8-3 Mt of low-emission hydrogen demand by 2030. However, the real impact of their pledges remains to be seen. These initiatives predominantly target new applications of hydrogen, and there is no dedicated coalition targeting the chemical and refining sectors, which are better placed to adopt low-emission hydrogen at scale in the short term.Scaling up low-emission hydrogen use is also key to enabling the nascent hydrogen trade. International trade of hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels is expected to be an important feature of a net zero future. In the NZE Scenario, more than 20% of demand for merchant hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels is internationally traded by 2030. Based on announced export-oriented projects, 16 Mt of hydrogen equivalent could be exported all around the world by 2030, but only three projects have reached FID. The realisation of these announced trade projects will depend on securing off-takers for the long run, as well as the implementation of certification schemes and deployment of the necessary infrastructure. Progress on infrastructure is moving slowly. There have been announcements for around 50 terminals and port infrastructure for hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels, and for up to 5 TWh of underground storage capacity aiming to be operative by 2030, but none of them has reached FID. Infrastructure projects typically have very long lead times, so it is critical to start developing them now to have a chance of them being available by 2030.\n",
      "Transforming momentum around hydrogen into deployment remains a struggle\n",
      "Political momentum behind low-emission hydrogen remains strong but deployment is not taking off. A total of 41 governments now have a hydrogen strategy in place and some of the early movers are updating their original strategies, raising ambitions. There is consensus that low-emission hydrogen is a key opportunity for decarbonising sectors where emissions are hard to abate. The energy crisis arising from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also turned a spotlight on the role that low-emission hydrogen can play in enhancing energy security. In addition, several major economies have recently adopted new industrial strategies, in which hydrogen technologies play a key part. Government policies and private sector plans are translating into an expanding flow of capital into the low-emission hydrogen sector. However, despite this momentum, low-emission hydrogen still accounts for less than 1% of global hydrogen production and use, and will need to grow more than 100-fold by 2030 to get in line with the NZE Scenario.Regulation and certification remain key barriers to adoption, but strong international co-operation can be crucial to finding solutions. Several countries have started putting in place regulations on hydrogen’s environmental attributes and developing associated certification schemes. These have some commonalities, but also significant divergences, which may lead to market fragmentation. Intergovernmental forums like the G7 and the G20 have recognised this risk and committed to work towards mutual recognition of certificates, which can facilitate market and regulatory interoperability. Referring to the emissions intensity of hydrogen production in regulation and certification – based on agreed methodology – can enable mutual recognition.1Governments need stronger policy action on multiple fronts to tap into the opportunity that low-emission hydrogen offers. Low-emission hydrogen can be an opportunity for countries to boost their economies for the future by creating industries along the supply chains of hydrogen technologies. In the Stated Policies Scenario, the market size of the low-emission hydrogen sector rises from USD 1.4 billion today to USD 12 billion by 2030, equivalent to the spending on offshore wind in Europe in 2022. Increasing ambitions in line with the NZE Scenario could expand the market size up to USD 112 billion, roughly the size of the market for rooftop solar PV installations in the Asia Pacific region in 2022. However, there are challenges around the expansion of technology manufacturing, as well as for creating demand and securing off-takers for low-emission hydrogen production. These challenges are to be expected in a sector that needs to build up complex value chains, but have been exacerbated by inflation, the fall in fossil fuel prices and sluggish policy implementation. Overcoming these challenges requires governments to act across the whole value chain, or progress will be disjointed and lead to cancellations and setbacks.\n",
      "Recommendations\n",
      "Urgently implement support schemes for low-emission hydrogen production and use Governments have announced numerous programmes to support first movers, but in most cases, these programmes are not yet implemented, or the funds have not yet been made available. This is hindering investment decisions for planned projects whose economic feasibility depends on public support, a situation that has worsened due to the impacts of inflation. Governments need to urgently implement these programmes and make funding available to enable a scale-up compatible with their decarbonisation ambitions. Take bolder action to stimulate demand creation for low-emission hydrogen, particularly in existing hydrogen usesGovernments must take the lead and implement policies that encourage action in the private sector, combining support measures with regulations (such as quotas or mandates) to require the adoption of low-emission hydrogen in existing applications. These measures can be complemented with technology-neutral regulations in priority sectors where alternative mitigation options exist (such as steel, shipping, aviation, and long-distance road transport), and with public procurement for low-emission and near-zero emission materials and products. Co-ordinated action is needed to unlock the necessary level of demand while facilitating a level playing field, avoiding industry relocation and carbon leakage. The private sector can also contribute by establishing an international co-operation initiative focused on demand aggregation in chemicals or refining, which are best suited to scale up demand in the short term.Foster international co-operation to accelerate solutions for hydrogen certification and mutual recognition of certificates Governments should keep moving forward with the implementation of clear regulations and associated certification schemes for hydrogen’s environmental attributes. International co-operation needs to be reinforced to prevent lack of alignment between these efforts, which could lead to market fragmentation. Full harmonisation seems impossible in the near term, but governments should work together to enable mutual recognition of certificates, which would allow a certain level of market interoperability. Referring to the emissions intensity of hydrogen production in regulations and certifications, based on a common methodology for determining the emissions, in line with the recommendations of the IEA’s report for the 2023 G7 Climate, Energy and Environment Ministerial meeting, Towards hydrogen definitions based on their emissions intensity, can facilitate the mutual recognition of certificates. Quickly address regulatory barriers, particularly for project licensing and permittingThe presence of a clear and stable regulatory framework must be balanced with a dynamic approach, calibrated to regular market monitoring, trying to make regulatory principles workable to not discourage investments. Governments should work to make licensing and permitting processes as efficient as possible and to improve co-ordination among different authorities involved in the process, to minimise their significant impact on project lead times, particularly for certain infrastructure developments, such as new pipelines, underground storage and import/export terminals. Support project developers to maintain momentum during the inflationary period and to extend regional reach Governments can take action with interventions that respond to near-term financial risks including loan guarantees, export credit facilities or public equity investment in projects, to help project developers that are struggling with increases in costs for equipment and capital. In addition, advanced economies need to raise concessional finance - beyond their recent commitments - and boost co-operation to facilitate the development of first-of-a-kind projects in emerging markets and developing economies, including through rapid standardisation of contract templates to overcome the unfamiliarity of parties with this new sector.\n",

      "The Rise of Green Hydrogen: Stats, Trends, and Future Projections\n",
      "\t\t\t\tJuly 16, 2024\t\t\t\t\n",
      "Green hydrogen is emerging as a game-changer in the quest for clean energy solutions. It is seen as a crucial element in reducing carbon emissions and helping the world transition to more sustainable energy sources. But what exactly is green hydrogen? Let’s take a look at the green hydrogen market.\n",
      "Green hydrogen is produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity generated from renewable sources like wind or solar power. This process, called electrolysis, results in hydrogen that is free from carbon emissions, hence the name “green hydrogen.”\n",
      "The concept of hydrogen as an energy source isn’t new. In fact, it has been around for decades. However, the increasing focus on climate change and the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have put green hydrogen back in the spotlight. Countries and companies worldwide are now investing heavily in green hydrogen technologies and infrastructure, recognizing its potential to revolutionize the energy landscape.\n",
      "The importance of green hydrogen cannot be overstated. Unlike traditional fossil fuels, green hydrogen combusts cleanly, reducing NOx by >90% over fossil fuel combustion, and producing primarily water vapor as a byproduct. This makes it an ideal candidate for replacing fossil fuels in various applications, from transportation to industrial processes. Unlike with fossil fuels, there is no CO or CO2 emitted when green hydrogen is combusted.  It can also be used as fuel for a fuel cell product, where it combines electrochemically with oxygen from the air to provide emission-free electricity that can be used in vehicles, generators, and other products.\n",
      "In this blog, we will explore the current state of the green hydrogen market, the technologies driving its growth, the regions leading its adoption, and the challenges and prospects of this promising energy solution.\n",
      "Industry Applications\n",
      "Green hydrogen is increasingly recognized for its versatility and potential to decarbonize various sectors. Here are eight key applications where green hydrogen is making a significant impact (Plug Power):\n",
      "Transportation: Green hydrogen is used to power fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), including buses, trucks, trains, and even ships. These vehicles emit only water vapor, providing a clean alternative to fossil fuels. Cities in Europe and North America are adopting hydrogen-powered buses to reduce urban pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Plug  is at the forefront of deploying hydrogen-powered forklifts in warehouses, further showcasing its utility in the logistics sector.\n",
      "Aviation: The aviation industry is exploring hydrogen as a key component for sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs). Hydrogen can be combined with captured CO2 to produce synthetic fuels, significantly reducing the carbon footprint of air travel. Companies like Airbus are developing hydrogen-powered aircraft, aiming to revolutionize the aviation sector by cutting down emissions.\n",
      "Industrial Processes: Green hydrogen is crucial in decarbonizing industrial processes, particularly in steel manufacturing. The Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) process uses hydrogen as a reducing agent to convert iron ore into steel, significantly lowering carbon emissions compared to traditional methods. Hydrogen is also being used in chemical production, including green ammonia and methanol, which are essential for fertilizers and other industrial applications.\n",
      "Energy Storage and Grid Balancing: Green hydrogen plays a vital role in energy storage, helping to balance the grid by storing excess renewable energy generated during periods of low demand and releasing it when demand is high. This capability is essential for integrating renewable energy sources like wind and solar into the energy grid, ensuring a stable and reliable power supply.\n",
      "Power Generation: Hydrogen can be used directly in fuel cells to generate electricity, providing a clean and efficient power source. This application is particularly useful in remote or off-grid locations where traditional power infrastructure is lacking. Fuel cells powered by hydrogen are being used to provide electricity and heat for residential and commercial buildings, as well as backup power for critical facilities.\n",
      "Heating: Green hydrogen can be used for heating applications in residential, commercial, and industrial settings. Hydrogen-powered boilers and heaters offer a low-carbon alternative to natural gas, helping to reduce emissions from heating systems. This application is especially relevant in countries with cold climates where heating demand is high.\n",
      "Synthetic Fuels Production: Hydrogen is a key ingredient in the production of synthetic fuels, which can be used in various applications, including transportation and industrial processes. By combining hydrogen with captured CO2, synthetic fuels can provide a carbon-neutral alternative to conventional fossil fuels, supporting the transition to a sustainable energy future.\n",
      "Maritime Transport: Hydrogen is being utilized in small scale demonstrations to power ships, and it is hoped hydrogen will provide a sustainable alternative to the heavy fuel oils traditionally used in the maritime industry.

      "Skip to main contentGlobal Energy Perspective 2023: Hydrogen outlookJanuary 10, 2024 | ArticleDespite some uncertainties across scenarios, global clean hydrogen demand is projected to grow significantly to 2050, but infrastructure scale-up and technology advancements are needed to meet projected demand.\n",
      " About the authorsThis article is a collaborative effort by Chiara Gulli, Bernd Heid, Jesse Noffsinger, Maurits Waardenburg, and Markus Wilthaner, representing views from McKinsey Energy Solutions.\n",
      "The Global Energy Perspective 2023 models the outlook for demand and supply of energy commodities across a 1.5°C pathway, aligned with the Paris Agreement, and four bottom-up energy transition scenarios. These energy transition scenarios examine outcomes ranging from warming of 1.6°C to 2.9°C by 2100 (scenario descriptions outlined below in sidebar “About the Global Energy Perspective 2023”). These wide-ranging scenarios sketch a range of outcomes based on varying underlying assumptions—for example, about the pace of technological progress and the level of policy enforcement. The scenarios are shaped by more than 400 drivers across sectors, technologies, policies, costs, and fuels, and serve as a fact base to inform decision makers on the challenges to be overcome to enable the energy transition. In this article, we explore how hydrogen could contribute to decarbonizing the energy system, uncertainties around hydrogen’s future role, and what it would take to set up a global hydrogen economy by 2050.\n",
      "Clean hydrogen demand is projected to increase to between 125 and 585 Mtpa by 2050Hydrogen demand today is largely supplied by fossil fuel-based steam methane reforming and driven by fertilizer production and refining. These industries are expected to lead the uptake of blue and green hydrogen until 2030 in the slower scenarios, as they switch their hydrogen-based operations to clean hydrogen. In parallel, “new” emerging applications—for instance in steel, in the production of synthetic fuels, and in heavy road transport—may begin to emerge in the faster scenarios.\n",
      "Nearly all hydrogen consumed today is grey hydrogen (approximately 90 million tons1Metric tons: 1 metric ton = 2,205 pounds. per annum [Mtpa]). However, demand for grey hydrogen is projected to decline as demand for clean hydrogen rises and costs of the green molecules eventually become more competitive.2Clean hydrogen includes both green hydrogen (hydrogen produced by the electrolysis of water using renewable energy as a power source) and blue hydrogen (hydrogen produced through steam reforming of natural gas or methane with carbon capture, utilization, and storage [CCUS]), and contrasts with grey hydrogen (hydrogen produced through the same process as blue hydrogen but without CCUS). By 2050, clean hydrogen demand could account for up to 73 to 100 percent (125 to 585 Mtpa) of total hydrogen demand, with only between less than 1 and 50 Mtpa of demand being met by grey hydrogen, depending on the scenario.\n",
      "After 2025, nearly all new hydrogen production coming online is expected to be clean hydrogen. This coincides with the start of the expected phaseout of grey hydrogen, driven by the growing cost competitiveness of clean hydrogen and commitments to decarbonize. Until 2030, clean hydrogen uptake is projected to be driven by existing applications switching from grey to blue and green hydrogen, but between 2030 and 2040 the uptake of hydrogen in new applications without existing demand is expected to drive the increase in clean hydrogen demand.\n",
      "After 2040, private and public sector commitments are projected to drive the uptake of clean hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels in emerging applications in the Further Acceleration and Achieved Commitments scenarios. Potential mechanisms that would be required to support demand growth of hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives in these applications include the implementation of, or increase in, CO2 pricing, quotas on sustainable fuels in aviation, or CO2-reduction targets in maritime transportation. On the other hand, in the Current Trajectory and Fading Momentum scenarios, hydrogen uptake is projected to be driven by a continuation of the current cost decline and the underlying growth in some of the fertilizer and chemicals markets that use hydrogen today, with limited new policy support.\n",
      "Some geographies, such as the European Union and United Kingdom, are expected to fully phase out grey hydrogen by 2050 in all scenarios except Fading Momentum. Grey hydrogen will likely play a larger role in the Fading Momentum scenario than in the faster energy transition scenarios, due to slower uptake of clean hydrogen in new sectors. In these sectors, uptake of clean hydrogen is projected to be limited until 2050.Industry is projected to drive the majority of clean hydrogen uptake until 2030, followed by a wider uptake in new applications by 2050Applications with existing demand will likely account for the majority of clean hydrogen demand throughout the 2020s, potentially driving the increase in clean hydrogen’s share of total hydrogen demand from less than 1 percent today to around 30 percent by 2030 in the Further Acceleration scenario.\n",
      "By 2040, clean hydrogen could play a larger role in new applications—especially in mobility, which is expected to be the largest “newcomer” for clean hydrogen demand by 2040 in the Further Acceleration scenario. Applications could range from fuel cell electric vehicles in long-haul, heavy-duty trucking to synthetic kerosene in aviation. The second largest newcomer is expected to be hydrogen used in (mainly industrial) heating, displacing natural gas. Combined, clean hydrogen uptake in existing applications and emerging applications could drive clean hydrogen’s share of total demand to 75 percent by 2040.\n",
      "By 2050, in the Further Acceleration scenario, mobility applications are projected to remain the largest drivers for clean hydrogen uptake, with road transport accounting for around 80 Mtpa and aviation around 50 Mtpa, with the remaining 15 Mtpa coming from maritime. Existing industrial applications and heating are projected to drive further clean hydrogen uptake, potentially resulting in clean hydrogen accounting for 95 percent of total hydrogen demand in 2050.\n",
      "However, uncertainties around demand growth remain. For example, power could drive an additional demand upside of between 60 and 70 Mtpa by 2050, on top of the projected demand in the Further Acceleration scenario. This could happen if hydrogen-fueled turbines or stationary fuel cells prove more competitive or have more public support than alternative technologies for the last-mile decarbonization of the energy system, such as long-duration energy storage technologies and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS).\n",
      "In the Fading Momentum scenario, the already existing end use of hydrogen in fertilizer production is expected to drive consumption far beyond 2030 corresponding with the lower total growth.\n",
      "The only sector that is not projected to see an increase in total hydrogen demand in 2050 compared to today is refining, with demand expected to peak in the late 2020s or early 2030s, depending on the scenario, driven by lower oil demand across scenarios.Uptake in new applications depends on operating environment, infrastructure development, and relative competitivenessGoing forward, the decarbonization agendas of governments and companies are expected to drive hydrogen uptake in new applications, as well as the decarbonization of existing grey hydrogen applications. However, in most regions, there is significant uncertainty around projected hydrogen uptake in these new applications across scenarios.\n",
      "The uncertainty surrounding hydrogen demand in emerging applications stems from a combination of factors, including lack of clarity in government support, the development of enabling infrastructure, and evolving competitive dynamics with other decarbonization technologies. For example, hydrogen’s role in decarbonizing aviation could depend on government support, as well as market dynamics and competition. First, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) quotas are needed across geographies to drive a switch from fossil fuel-based kerosene to clean alternatives. Second, hydrogen-based synthetic fuels would have to prove competitive with the main SAF alternatives, for instance biokerosene, either based on costs or constraints in the availability of feedstock necessary to produce biokerosene.\n",
      "Similarly, there is uncertainty about the switch from grey to clean hydrogen. Active mandates, such as CO2 prices and subsidies, will likely be needed to facilitate the decarbonization of existing hydrogen demand, as the switch will likely not be attractive based on economics alone.Infrastructure scale-up and technology advancements could be criticalIn key sectors, the timely deployment of infrastructure across the whole supply chain is projected to be needed to meet clean hydrogen demand.\n",
      "Several key enablers—mostly physical infrastructure—would have to be rolled out by 2050 to facilitate the future hydrogen economy. In the Achieved Commitments scenario, over 163,000 refueling stations for trucks would be needed globally, alongside a network of more than 40,000 kilometers of hydrogen pipelines in Europe alone.\n",
      "Technological advancements may also be needed to ensure the uptake of hydrogen in sectors where hydrogen technology is not yet mature, such as the further development of fuel cells for heavy-duty vehicles and marine vessels.\n",
      "Coordination between government and the private sector may be needed to ensure the required infrastructure is in place to meet hydrogen demand at the pace necessary to meet decarbonization commitments and with an attractive business case.\n",
      "The extent of the growth and advancement necessary to establish a hydrogen economy is not without precedent—historical adoption of natural gas in the European Union since the 1960s and 70s shows that it is possible to rapidly change an established energy system if the necessary competitiveness and support are in place.Asia is projected to remain the region with the largest hydrogen demand to 2050Despite uncertainties in regional and sectoral demand, Asia is projected to remain the biggest hydrogen consumer across scenarios, largely driven by the demand from chemicals that already exist today, and, to a lesser extent, the transport, iron, and steel sectors in China and India. In Japan and South Korea, a significant share of hydrogen demand is expected to come from electricity generation as ammonia and hydrogen are blended in existing coal and gas plants, respectively. As Asia will likely not produce enough hydrogen to meet its growing demand, the region might rely on imports from Oceania or the Middle East, for instance.\n",
      "In Europe and the United States, the chemicals sector is projected to remain a significant driver of hydrogen demand, but new applications in sectors including steel and production of synthetic fuels for aviation, maritime, and heavy road transport are also expected to contribute significantly to demand growth.Green hydrogen production is projected to be spread across regions, while blue hydrogen production is geography-specificBy 2050, green hydrogen is expected to dominate the global supply mix, with a share of between 50 and 65 percent across scenarios, as cost reductions in renewables and electrolyzers make this production route more cost competitive. Blue hydrogen is projected to account for the next largest share of supply, at between 20 and 35 percent.\n",
      "The ratio of blue to green hydrogen production is expected to differ significantly by region, driven mainly by cost factor developments. Blue hydrogen production is projected to be concentrated in regions with cost-competitive natural gas and CCUS, such as the Middle East and North America. By 2050, blue hydrogen production could require as much as around 500 billion cubic meters of natural gas (between 10 and 15 percent of global natural gas demand in the Further Acceleration scenario), and capacity to capture and store 750 to 1,000 megatons of CO2.\n",
      "Green hydrogen production is projected to have a higher share in regions with abundant and cost-competitive renewable resources, such as Australia and Iberia. The production of green hydrogen could potentially be constrained by a lack of renewable power. Globally, approximately a quarter of renewable electricity generation (around 14,000 terawatt-hours) could be required to produce the green hydrogen needed by 2050 in the Further Acceleration scenario. Further potential bottlenecks to be tackled to achieve strong green hydrogen uptake include large-scale investments and deployment of at-scale manufacturing of electrolyzers, with cost competitiveness being strongly dependent on the latter.Clean hydrogen cost competitiveness is projected to vary between regionsClean hydrogen production costs are expected to drop significantly by 2030–50, with large differences across regions under the scenarios explored. Cost differentials among regions could drive an increased mismatch between supply and demand centers and thus lead to the development of major hydrogen and hydrogen-derivatives export hubs.\n",
      "Regions with cost-competitive natural gas resources and CCUS, such as the Middle East, Norway, and the United States, are expected to have the highest cost competitiveness and could potentially account for 30 percent of exports at production costs of below $1.5/kg by 2050.\n",
      "Regions with access to low-cost renewable power, such as Australia or North Africa, could make up an additional 60 percent of exports at production costs of between $1.5/kg and $2/kg.\n",
      "The growing hydrogen trade could enable uptake in countries that have strong decarbonization ambitions but lack the necessary energy resources for clean hydrogen production, such as parts of Europe, as well as Japan and South Korea.A global hydrogen trade could emerge to connect demand centers with resource-rich export hubsMajor hydrogen trade flows are expected to evolve to connect export hubs with favorable renewable power or natural gas resources to two main demand regions: Asia and Europe.\n",
      "Europe could meet most of its demand from within the region, importing from countries with low gas prices or abundant hydro and solar power, such as Iberia and the Nordics. The remainder could be sourced from the Middle East, North Africa, and North America. Asia could source hydrogen from countries and regions like Australia, Latin America, the Middle East, and North America.\n",
      "Regions with favorable routes to market—either by producing and shipping as derivatives or building a strategic network of hydrogen pipelines toward off-takers, potentially re-using existing natural gas infrastructure—may also emerge as production hubs.\n",
      "While major trade flows in Europe will likely depend heavily on pipelines, shipping could prove critical to enable overseas trade. Hydrogen shipping could be expedited by converting hydrogen to synfuels (such as ammonia or methanol) at export hubs. Liquid hydrogen shipment could be one way to enable the global hydrogen trade after 2030, potentially increasing to approximately 20 Mtpa traded in 2050 in the faster scenarios.\n",
      "Although this projected ramp-up of the global hydrogen trade is ambitious, it does have historical precedent—similar growth was observed in the first 25 years of LNG development.\n",
      " About the Global Energy Perspective 2023 \n",
      "Hydrogen is a versatile energy carrier that has the potential to play a significant role in decarbonizing the energy system. Hydrogen-based technologies and fuels can provide low-carbon alternatives across sectors. However, as of now, there is still a wide range of possible hydrogen pathways up to 2050 both in terms of hydrogen demand and supply, leading to uncertainty for organizations looking to enter the hydrogen market or to scale their operations.\n",
      "Government and private sector support is projected to heavily affect hydrogen uptake. At the same time, future technological developments of alternatives (for instance, high-temperature electric furnaces, long-duration energy storage, and availability of biobased feedstock) could also create competition in some of the new applications for hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels. Hydrogen companies may benefit from closely monitoring signposts on policies, the development of hydrogen-enabling infrastructure, and the cost-competitiveness of hydrogen-based technologies compared to other low-carbon alternatives as they chart their way forward.\n",

Investments in hydrogen could contribute to global decarbonization efforts, which is already InvestorPlace • 6 days ago PLUG -4.12% BLDP +0.90% CrowdStrike sinks on outage, energy sector struggles: Morning Brief On today's episode of Morning Brief, Hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith break down the market open and some of the biggest stories dominating the trading week. All three of the major averages (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) opened lower on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling by over 0.3% at the market open. The tech-heavy indexes are being dragged down as markets react to global outages tied to a CrowdStrike (CRWD) update. Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike has identified the source of the disruption as a flaw in a single update for certain Microsoft (MSFT) Windows hosts. CrowdStrike's CEO says that the issue has been identified so it companies can fix the issue. Defused Cyber Deception researcher and founder Simo Kohonen emphasizes CrowdStrike's reputation as the \"top number one cybersecurity company in the world\" and notes that their extensive customer base amplifies the scale of this issue. He adds, \"I think CrowdStrike will have a lot of conversations with their current customers and their future customers about what they're doing differently.

The streamer topped estimates and revealed it added 8 million subscribers despite missing Wall Street expectations for third quarter earnings guidance.

And also kind of on the near term. They expect the ad tier to reach critical scale by next year in all 12 of the AVoD [Advertising-based Video on Demand] markets.\" As the small-cap Russell 2000 (^RUT) index has climbed by nearly 200 points in the past week and a half, Carson Group Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick discusses why a potential rotation out of big Tech may not entirely be \"shocking.\" \"I think we expected this type of move [out of Tech]. And honestly, guys, we think it's going to continue,\" he says, adding, \"Doesn't mean we hate tech. We're more neutral tech, but we really think these other underloved, underappreciated, and under-owned areas are probably going be pretty good the second half of this year.\" Finally, the energy sector is slipping as shares SunPower (SPWR) tanked around 30% on Friday morning after the company reportedly notified dealers that as of September 17, it will no longer support new leases and halt shipments.

      "\n",
      "#### Price Targets:\n",
