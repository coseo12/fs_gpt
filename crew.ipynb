      "- 1 cup water\n",
      "- 1/2 cup honey (or agave syrup for vegan version)\n",
      "- 1 tsp vanilla extract\n",
      "- 1 tsp lemon juice\n",
      "\n",
      "**Preparation Instructions:**\n",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).\n",
      "2. In a bowl, combine the chopped walnuts and cinnamon.\n",
      "3. Brush a 9x13 inch baking dish with melted butter. Layer 8 sheets of phyllo dough in the dish, brushing each with melted butter.\n",
      "4. Sprinkle a thin layer of the walnut mixture over the phyllo. Add two more sheets of phyllo dough, brushing each with butter, and sprinkle with more walnut mixture. Repeat until all the walnut mixture is used.\n",
      "5. Finish with a top layer of 8 sheets of phyllo, brushing each with butter.\n",
      "6. Using a sharp knife, cut the baklava into diamond or square shapes.\n",
      "7. Bake for 45-50 minutes until golden and crisp.\n",
      "8. While the baklava is baking, combine the sugar, water, honey, vanilla extract, and lemon juice in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.\n",
      "9. Pour the hot syrup over the baklava as soon as it comes out of the oven. Let cool completely before serving.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Serving Suggestions:**\n",
      "Serve the baklava at room temperature with a cup of Greek coffee or tea.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation of Replaced Ingredients:**\n",
      "1. **Greek Salad**: The feta cheese can be replaced with vegan feta cheese to make it suitable for vegans while maintaining the essence of the salad.\n",
      "2. **Moussaka**: The ground lamb or beef has been replaced with a combination of chickpeas and lentils to provide a hearty and protein-rich filling. Whole milk can be replaced with unsweetened plant-based milk, and Parmesan cheese can be replaced with vegan Parmesan cheese to make it vegan-friendly.\n",
      "3. **Baklava**: Unsalted butter can be replaced with vegan butter, and honey can be replaced with agave syrup to make the baklava vegan-friendly without compromising its classic sweetness and texture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoy your healthy vegetarian Greek dinner!\n",
